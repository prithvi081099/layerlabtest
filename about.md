The Layer  Lab is computational genomics (i.e., dry) research group in the
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and the
[Biofrontiers Institue](https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/) at the 
[University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/), 
[Boulder](https://bouldercolorado.gov/). The lab focuses
on developing methods that can
leverage population-scale datasets to understand better how genetic variation
affects human health. 

Since the work is at the intersection of computer science and genomics, the
interdisciplinary environment of the BioFrontiers Institute is the
perfect place to conduct this style of research.  The lab is also affiliated
with the Division of Biomedical Informatics and Personalized Medicine in the CU
Department of Medicine. This connection helps the lab stay current with the
needs of the community and gives us access to the latest datasets.
