to Phenome Initiative’s (AG2PI) workshop series this Thursday, Dec 2, 2021,
from 12:00 to 2:00pm (MST). AG2PI is a United States Department of
Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) funded
project whose focus is to integrate cross-discipline expertise in an effort to
further our understanding of how the complex relationship between genotype,
phenotype, and environmental factors influence crop and livestock production.</p>

<p>We are very excited to share our recent work on structural variant (SV) calling
on population wide short-read sequencing data. Ryan, Murad, and Devin will walk
through the steps required to perform SV calling as well as SV genotyping on a
small salmon population, followed by our filtering and curation methods, and
finally with a discussion on some possible avenues of analytic exploration
using the SVs.</p>

<p>We hope via the workshop the participants will walk away with an appreciation
for each of the steps in our SV calling pipeline such that they will be able to
extract SVs from their own datasets with high confidence as well as perform
their own analysis on their results. These steps will include the process of
aligning sequencing data to a reference genome, identifying and excluding
problematic regions in the sample data and the reference genome, perform SV
calling and genotyping on each sample, and finally merge to produce a
population level genotyped SV cohort.</p>

<p>In the analysis portion of the workshop we aim to walk the participants through
various tools that allow for querying of a VCF file and how we can use those to
find interesting and relevant evolutionary artifacts such as the loss of
particular mobile elements in a species. We will also discuss how to perform
phylogenetic analysis on extracted sequences of interest. Finally we will show
participants the process of performing PCA on SV data to validate separation of
subpopulations in the species population.</p>

<p>Attendance for this virtual workshop requires registration
<a href="https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/84">here</a></p>

<p>A recording will be available sometime in the future at
<a href="http://www.ag2pi.org">www.ag2pi.org</a> and we will also have a detailed written
guide with tutorials on each of the steps available shortly.</p>

suffer from high false positive rates.  We have shown that it is possible to
spot false positive SV calls using Samplot visualizations, but manual curation
of large SV callsets can be a long and tedious process.  To that end we
developed Samplot-ML to discriminate between true and false positive deletion
SVs.</p>

<p>For the better part of the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have been used in image recognition tasks across a wide range of domains.
Since Samplot was demonstrated to be an effective visualization tool for
curating SV callsets, it made sense to try to train a CNN to be able to do it
for us.</p>

<p>The workflow for Samplot-ML is simple: given a whole-genome sequenced sample
(BAM or CRAM) as well as a set of putative deletions (VCF), Samplot-ML
re-genotypes each putative deletion using the Samplot-generated image. The
result is a call set where most false positives are flagged.  For
installation/usage instructions see our github <a href="https://github.com/mchowdh200/samplot-ml">github repo</a></p>

<h2 id="example-usage">Example Usage:</h2>

<p>To demonstrate how to use Samplot-ML, let’s work through a simple example that
takes us from calling SV’s to executing the Samplot-ML snakefile using some
data from the 1000 genomes project (1kg).</p>

<ul>
  <li>PREF, PHET, and PALT: the prediction score assigned by the model which
corresponds to a prediction of a 0/0, 0/1, or 1/1 genotype, respectively. If
the region in the input vcf was originally a 0/0, then these fields will
contain ‘nan’ values</li>
  <li>OLDGT: The original genotype of the region from the input
SV callset.</li>

 will replace the GT field with the predicted genotype.</li>

<p>It seems that in the very first deletion we came across, there was a difference between SVTyper’s prediction and Samplot-ML’s prediction. We went from a heterozygous deletion (0/1) to a homozygous alternate deletion (1/1). Let’s take a look at the image in question.</p>

with the <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/">Dan Larremore</a> at CU and 
<a href="https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bailey/">Bailey Fosdick</a> at CSU, is using mobility data from
<a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/">Facebook Data for
Good</a> to help state
and local governments monitor activey in their jurisdicitons while stay-at-home
orders are in place and as reopening begins.</p>

<p>We are currently working directly with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boulder County, CO</li>
  <li>Arapahoe County, CO</li>
  <li>Denver, CO</li>
  <li>Salt Lake County, UT</li>
  <li>University of Colorado, Boulder</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook provides aggregaed an annonmized user density data three times per day
for tiles that range in size from 2km to 0.6km squater.</p>

<p>From this data we have developed metrics that measure activity trends.  Some of
our metrics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A weekend score measures the differences between weekday and weekend activity.
Ideally, if people are staying home and not working, there should not be a
difference.</li>
</ul>

</center>
<ul>
  <li>A slip score, which measures the difference in activity between adjacent
weeks. This score should be near zero during a stay-at-home order.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A hot-spot score, which measures the difference between current activity and
activity during the first week of the stay-at-home order.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also using models to decompose the data into seasonal (night/day, weekday/weekend) and trend values.</p>

<p>To help explore these data, we are developing an interactive browser using 
<a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">plotly dash</a>. Here is a quick demo of our data browser:</p>
