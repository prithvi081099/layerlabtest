STIX ([Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01423-4),
[GitHub](https://github.com/ryanlayer/stix)) was covered by a few media
outlets.

Josh Rhoten with the CU College of Engineering & Applied Science wrote a piece 
on STIX called [New software aims to speed and improve identification of DNA variations that lead to cancer](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2022/04/11/new-software-aims-speed-and-improve-identification-dna-variations-lead-cancer)

In collaboration with (The Conversation)[https://theconversation.com/us] I wrote
and [article about STIX](https://theconversation.com/genetic-mutations-can-be-benign-or-cancerous-a-new-method-to-differentiate-between-them-could-lead-to-better-treatments-181413) that was picked up by quite a few news organizations.
