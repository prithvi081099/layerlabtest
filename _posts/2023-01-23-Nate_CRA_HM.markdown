Research Association's (CRA) [Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award for 2023](https://cra.org/crn/2023/01/2023-outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award-recipients/). Nate has been working on identifying peptide sequences from mass spec data for the last two years, and this honor is highly deserved.
