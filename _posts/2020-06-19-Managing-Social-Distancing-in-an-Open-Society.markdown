Here is a talk I gave about our work on monitor social distancing at the county/city/campus level.

The first half of the work is part of the
[COVID-19 Mobility Data Network](https://www.covid19mobility.org/), and is collaboration with 
with the [Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/) at CU and 
[Bailey Fosdick](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bailey/) at CSU.
