I am excited to announce that I will be starting my lab in Summer 2018 at The
University of Colorado Boulder in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and the [BioFrontiers
Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/). It is bittersweet to leave
the [Quinlan lab](http://quinlanlab.org/) after MANY years (~8), but it is
time.  Aaron has been a fantastic mentor, and I suggest that anyone interested
in method development and not interested in living the beautiful Boulder
Colorado and working in a beautiful new BioFrontiers building (see below)
should consider joining his lab. 

My lab will focus on developing methods for:
- analyzing large-scale genome datasets (e.g., GQT and GIGGLE)
- structural variant analysis (e.g., LUMPY)
- supporting rare disease research and diagnosis

I will be hiring postdocs, programmers, and grad students. If you are
interested, please contact me: ryan at layerlab dot org.
