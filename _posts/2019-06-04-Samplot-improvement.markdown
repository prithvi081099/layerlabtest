We have made two major updates to Samplot
## 1. Split view

The original version of samplot visualized one continuous genomic region, which
made viewing translocations impossible and large SVs difficult and
time-consuming. By providing support for two areas, we can now plot the two
ends of a translocation and zoom into the breakpoints of large SVs.

Here is the chromosome 2/X inverted translocation that we identified in a
patient with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) [BE Ostrander et
al., Genomic Medicine 2018]. Notice the break in the middle that is indicated
by an ellipsis in the SV plot on top and whitespace in the sample plot. Split
view support has also been extended to annotation and transcript plots, as seen
below.

This plot is generated by providing 2 sets of chromosomal positions and using
the `--zoom` parameter to specify the size of the flanking regions.

```
python samplot.py \
    -c 2 -s 59405943 -e 59405943 \
    -c X -s 151118533 -e 151118533 \
    -b samplot/test/data/2_59305747-59505747_X_151018513-151218513.BND.bam
    -o translocation.png \
    -t BND \
    --zoom 10000
```

Here are the original and zoomed plots for a 45Kb deletion in HG002 sample from
the GIAB Ashkenazim Trio. The full plot took four seconds to complete and the
zoom took one second.

Generating a zoomed plot is straightforward, add the `--zoom` parameter:
```
python samplot.py \
    -c 1 -s 72766323 -e 72811839 \
    -b HG002.hs37d5.2x250.bam \
    -o big_zoom.png \
    -t DEL \
    -d 10 \
    --zoom 1000
```
## 2. SV VCF browser

Given a VCF with SVs and the sample BAMs, run `samplot_vcf.py` to generate the
variants plots and a web page that provides an interface to browse the plots.
For example, the SVs in `samplot/test/data/test.vcf` produce the following
site.  Basic information about the SVs is given in each row, and an SV plot can
be displayed below by clicking on the row.

We have many improvemtns planned for this interface, so stay tuned.

</center>

The command to produce this site is:
```
    python ../../src/samplot_vcf.py \
        -d output_dir \
        --vcf test.vcf \
        --sample_ids HG002 HG003 HG004 \
        -b ../data/HG002_Illumina.bam \
        ../data/HG003_Illumina.bam \
        ../data/HG004_Illumina.bam \
        --command_file samplot_commands.sh
```
This command will create the directory `output_dir`, `output_dir/index.html`,
and `samplot_commands.sh` which contains the commands needed to generate the
samplot images. Run `bash samplot_commands.sh` and the plots will be placed
into `output_dir`, and begin browsing.

See the [samplot page](https://github.com/ryanlayer/samplot)
for the full documentation.
