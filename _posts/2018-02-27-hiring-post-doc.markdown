The Layer Laboratory in the BioFrontiers Institute and the Department of
Computer Science seeks a Post Doc to develop new algorithms, computational
approaches, and data visualization techniques that empower researchers to solve
the genetic basis of human diseases.

 
We are looking for a talented, highly motivated, independent scientist with
strong programming skills. We are a new lab and are looking for a passionate
scientist to join the team.

 
The successful candidate will join a dynamic, growing team of scientists,
software developers, and clinicians working to integrate computational genomics
into health care. Our research develops open-source methods that enable
efficient exploration of large and diverse genetic databases. Ongoing projects
include:

 
[LUMPY](https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy-sv): mining whole genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants
 
[Genotype query tools](https://github.com/ryanlayer/gqt): a compressed index
and query interface for exploring large-scale genotype datasets
 
[GIGGLE](https://github.com/ryanlayer/giggle): a search engine for genome annotations
 
[STIX](https://github.com/ryanlayer/stix): mining thousands of genomes to find structural variant population frequencies

Responsibilities:
- Develop new algorithms, software, and visualization tools for genetics disease research
- Analyze genomic data using command-line and web-based computational tools to discover the genetic basis for disease.
- Collaborate with clinicians, software developers, and analysts across multiple academic departments and initiatives to ensure  efficient project completion and rigorous research outcomes.
 
Qualifications
 
Minimum:
- Ph.D. in computer science, mathematics, bioinformatics or a related discipline
Proficient in a compiled language (C or C++) and a scripting language
- Ability to work with large datasets in a variety of settings including the use of both web-based and command line tools in a Linux environment
- Collaborative – able to work interactively on projects with a variety of researchers, software developers, and medical professionals to enable discovery of disease-causing genetic variants
- Articulate – able to discuss research design and results effectively with clinical, research and technical team.
 
Desired:
- Previous research experience in genetics, medical genetics and/or genotype/phenotype association analyses is a plus, but not required.
