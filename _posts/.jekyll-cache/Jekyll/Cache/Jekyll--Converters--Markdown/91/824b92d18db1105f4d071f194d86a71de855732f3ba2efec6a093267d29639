I"­<p>I am excited to announce that I will be starting my lab in Summer 2018 at The
University of Colorado Boulder in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/">Department of Computer
Science</a> and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/">BioFrontiers
Institute</a>. It is bittersweet to leave
the <a href="http://quinlanlab.org/">Quinlan lab</a> after MANY years (~8), but it is
time.  Aaron has been a fantastic mentor, and I suggest that anyone interested
in method development and not interested in living the beautiful Boulder
Colorado and working in a beautiful new BioFrontiers building (see below)
should consider joining his lab.</p>

<p>My lab will focus on developing methods for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>analyzing large-scale genome datasets (e.g., GQT and GIGGLE)</li>
  <li>structural variant analysis (e.g., LUMPY)</li>
  <li>supporting rare disease research and diagnosis</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be hiring postdocs, programmers, and grad students. If you are
interested, please contact me: ryan at layerlab dot org.</p>
